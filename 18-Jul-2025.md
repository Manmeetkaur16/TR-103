# 18 July - Daily Diary

## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **Connecting Frontend and Backend**

  * Learned how the frontend (React) communicates with the backend (Node.js + Express)  
  * Understood how API endpoints created in Express can be consumed by the frontend  
  * Explored the complete flow:
    * User performs an action on frontend  
    * Frontend sends a request to backend  
    * Backend processes request + interacts with database  
    * Backend sends response back to frontend  
    * Frontend displays the updated result  
  * Configured API base URLs and handled CORS issues when connecting both sides  

* **Sending Requests from Frontend to Backend**

  * Practiced sending various types of requests using `fetch()` and `axios`  
  * Implemented:
    * **GET requests** → Fetching data from backend  
    * **POST requests** → Sending user input or login/register data  
    * **PUT / PATCH requests** → Updating user details  
    * **DELETE requests** → Removing data from database  

  * Basic example practiced:
    ```js
    fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/user", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
    ```

  * Learned how to handle:
    * API responses  
    * Errors  
    * Loading states  
    * Updating the UI after receiving the backend response
