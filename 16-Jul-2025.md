## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **State in Functional Components**

  * Learned how to manage data inside components using the `useState()` hook  
  * Understood that state allows components to:
    * Store dynamic values  
    * Re-render automatically when data changes  
  * Practiced examples like:
    * Counters  
    * Input field handling  
    * Updating UI based on state changes  

* **Props**

  * Understood that props are used to pass data **from parent to child components**  
  * Props are **read-only**, so child components cannot modify them  
  * Practiced passing:
    * Strings  
    * Numbers  
    * Functions  
    * Arrays and objects  
  * Built simple reusable components using props  

* **Event Handling**

  * Learned how to handle events like:
    * `onClick`  
    * `onChange`  
    * `onSubmit`  
  * Explored how event handlers are written in React:
    ```jsx
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    ```
  * Understood binding values to events and updating state based on user actions  

* **Basic Forms in React**

  * Built simple forms using React components  
  * Handled input fields by updating state with `onChange`  
  * Used controlled components to manage form values  
  * Practiced handling form submission and validation  

* **Storing Register User Data Using `useState()`**

  * Created form fields for:
    * Name  
    * Email  
    * Password  
  * Used a single state object to store all user data:
    ```jsx
    const [user, setUser] = useState({
      name: "",
      email: "",
      password: ""
    });
    ```
  * Updated user data on input change:
    ```jsx
    const handleChange = (e) => {
      setUser({ ...user, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };
    ```
  * Understood how to send this data to backend on form submit  

* **Storing Token in Cookies**

  * Learned how cookies are used to store authentication tokens  
  * Used browser cookies to:
    * Store the token after successful login  
    * Access token for authenticated routes  
  * Basic example practiced:
    ```js
    document.cookie = `token=${token}; path=/`;
    ```
  * Understood importance of:
    * Security  
    * Cookie expiration  
    * HttpOnly cookies (conceptually)  
  * Saw how cookies help maintain login sessions across pages
