# 9 July - Daily Diary

## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **ES6 Features**

  * Explored modern JavaScript features introduced in ES6  
  * Understood how ES6 simplifies coding, improves readability, and provides cleaner syntax  

* **let & const**

  * Learned differences between variable declarations:
    * `let` → block-scoped, can be updated  
    * `const` → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned  
  * Understood scope behavior and why `var` is less preferred today  

* **Arrow Functions**

  * Practiced writing shorter and cleaner functions using arrow syntax  
  * Examples learned:
    ```js
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```
  * Understood how arrow functions handle `this` keyword differently than regular functions  

* **Template Literals**

  * Used backticks (`` ` ``) to create dynamic strings  
  * Practiced embedding expressions using `${value}`  
  * Useful for:
    * Multi-line strings  
    * Dynamic messages  
    * String formatting  

* **Spread & Rest Operators**

  * Learned how the spread operator (`...`) expands arrays or objects  
    * Example: copying arrays, merging objects  
  * Learned how the rest operator collects multiple arguments into one array  
    * Used in functions to handle unlimited parameters  

* **Event Loop / Async JS Basics**

  * Understood how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations  
  * Learned concepts:
    * Call stack  
    * Web APIs  
    * Callback queue  
    * Event loop process  
  * Practiced simple asynchronous functions using:
    * `setTimeout()`  
    * Promises (basic overview)
