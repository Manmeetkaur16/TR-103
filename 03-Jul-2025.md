## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **What is JavaScript?**

  * Learned that JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used to make web pages dynamic and interactive  
  * Understood its role in controlling behavior, manipulating the DOM, handling events, and performing logic on web pages  
  * Compared JavaScript with HTML/CSS:
    * HTML → Structure  
    * CSS → Styling  
    * JavaScript → Functionality  

* **Variables & Datatypes**

  * Learned how to store values using variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
  * Understood the difference between:
    * `let` → block-scoped, reassignable  
    * `const` → block-scoped, constant  
    * `var` → function-scoped (older method)

  * Explored JavaScript **datatypes**:
    * Primitive: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`  
    * Non-primitive: `object`, `array`, `function`  

* **Strings & Numbers**

  * Manipulated strings using:
    * Concatenation (`+`)
    * Template literals (`` `${value}` ``)
    * Common methods: `.length`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`  

  * Worked with numbers:
    * Basic arithmetic operations  
    * Type conversion between strings and numbers  
    * Concept of `NaN` (Not a Number)  

* **Operators**

  * Practiced various types of operators:
    * **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
    * **Comparison:** `==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`  
    * **Logical:** `&&`, `||`, `!`  
    * **Assignment:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`  
  * Understood how operators are used in conditions, loops, and functions  

* **Conditionals**

  * Learned how to control program flow using conditional statements  
  * Practiced:
    * `if` statements  
    * `if-else` statements  
    * `else if` ladders  
    * Nested conditions  
  * Understood real-world usage, such as checking user input or validating data  
  * Example practiced:
    ```js
    let age = 18;
    if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are eligible.");
    } else {
      console.log("Not eligible.");
    }
