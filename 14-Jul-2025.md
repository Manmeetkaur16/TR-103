* **Introduction to MongoDB**

  * Learned that MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store data in the form of **documents**  
  * Understood the structure:
    * Database → Collections → Documents  
  * Compared MongoDB with SQL databases and saw how it is flexible, schema-less, and easy to scale  
  * Explored basic operations such as:
    * Inserting documents  
    * Finding data  
    * Updating and deleting records  
  * Understood why MongoDB is widely used with Node.js and Express  

* **Registering a New User**

  * Implemented a backend route to register a user  
  * Steps learned:
    * Accepting data from frontend (name, email, password)  
    * Validating the input  
    * Storing user data in MongoDB  
  * Discussed password hashing (conceptually) for secure storage  
  * Ensured the API sends a proper response after successful registration  

* **OTP Verification**

  * Learned how OTP-based verification works  
  * Flow understood:
    * Generate a random OTP  
    * Send OTP to the user via email or other method  
    * Store OTP temporarily

  * Practiced backend logic for verifying OTP before completing registration  
  * Understood the importance of verification for security and authenticity

  * Created a login route using Express  
  * Steps practiced:
    * Fetching user data from MongoDB  
    * Checking if email exists  
    * Comparing entered password with stored password  
    * Sending proper success or error responses  
  * Understood session logic and why authentication is important in real-world applications
