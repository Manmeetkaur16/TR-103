## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **Promises**

  * Learned how Promises help handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript  
  * Understood the three states of a Promise:
    * **Pending**
    * **Resolved (Fulfilled)**
    * **Rejected**
  * Practiced using:
    * `new Promise()`
    * `.then()` to handle success
    * `.catch()` to handle errors
    * `.finally()` for cleanup  
  * Understood why Promises make async code more readable than nested callbacks  

* **Fetching Data from an API**

  * Used the `fetch()` function to call public APIs  
  * Learned the lifecycle of an API request:
    * Send request → wait for response → convert to JSON → use data  
  * Practiced the basic pattern:
    ```js
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```
  * Understood how API communication works in modern web applications  

* **Displaying Data Dynamically on a Web Page**

  * Learned how to:
    * Create new DOM elements using JavaScript  
    * Insert fetched data into the HTML layout  
    * Loop through API responses and generate UI elements dynamically  
  * Built simple UI components to show fetched items on screen  
  * Practiced updating existing elements with new data  

* **Created a Simple Stopwatch**

  * Implemented a basic stopwatch using:
    * `setInterval()` for timing  
    * DOM manipulation to update the display  
    * Buttons for Start, Stop, and Reset  
  * Improved understanding of:
    * Events  
    * Timers  
    * Updating UI in real-time  
  * Successfully built a functional mini-project combining JavaScript logic + DOM updates
