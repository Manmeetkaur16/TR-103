# 15 July - Daily Diary

## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **What is React?**

  * Learned that React is a JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces  
  * Understood that React follows a **component-based architecture**, making UI reusable and easier to maintain  
  * Explored why React is fast:
    * Uses Virtual DOM  
    * Efficient re-rendering  
    * One-way data flow for predictable state changes  

* **create-react-app**

  * Used `create-react-app` to quickly set up a new React project  
  * Understood that CRA automatically configures:
    * Webpack  
    * Babel  
    * Development server  
    * Project folder structure  
  * Ran the project locally using:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```  

* **Component Structure**

  * Learned how everything in React is built using components  
  * Types of components:
    * Functional components  
    * Class components (older approach)  
  * Understood component structure:
    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return <h1>Hello React!</h1>;
    }
    ```
  * Each component returns JSX and handles its own UI logic  

* **JSX Basics**

  * Understood that JSX is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript  
  * Learned JSX rules:
    * Must return a single parent element  
    * `className` instead of `class`  
    * JavaScript expressions inside `{ }`  
  * Practiced writing simple JSX elements and embedding variables  

* **Virtual DOM**

  * Studied how Virtual DOM improves performance  
  * Flow learned:
    * React updates Virtual DOM first  
    * Compares differences with actual DOM  
    * Updates only the changed parts (efficient rendering)  
  * Understood why React apps feel fast even with many UI updates
