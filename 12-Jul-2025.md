## 📘 Topics Covered Today

* **Introduction to Node.js**

  * Learned that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used to run JS outside the browser  
  * Understood how Node.js enables server-side programming using JavaScript  
  * Explored why Node.js is fast, scalable, and event-driven  

* **What is Server Side?**

  * Understood the concept of server-side programming  
  * Learned how servers handle user requests, process data, and return responses  
  * Compared frontend (client-side) vs backend (server-side) roles  

* **Request and Response**

  * Studied the request-response cycle  
  * Understood:
    * Request → client sends data to the server  
    * Response → server sends back output  
  * Saw how HTTP methods help classify the type of request  

* **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

  * Understood the fundamentals of HTTP  
  * Learned how HTTP defines communication rules between client and server  
  * Explored common HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  

* **Creating a Server Using Node.js**

  * Practiced building a basic server using the built-in `http` module  
  * Understood steps:
    * Importing the module  
    * Creating a server  
    * Listening on a port  
  * Realized the structure is lengthy and not beginner-friendly  

* **Difficulty in Creating Server Using Node.js**

  * Observed that writing backend logic using only Node.js core modules becomes:
    * Verbose  
    * Repetitive  
    * Hard to manage routing  
  * Motivated need for a framework like Express.js  

* **Introduction to Express.js**

  * Learned that Express.js is a lightweight, fast backend framework for Node.js  
  * Provides easy routing, middleware, and simplified server creation  
  * Makes working with APIs and requests much easier  

* **Creating a Server Using Express**

  * Created a basic Express server using just a few lines of code  
  * Practiced:
    * Importing Express  
    * Initializing the app  
    * Defining routes  
    * Listening on a port  

* **Sending Response from Backend**

  * Used `res.send()` and `res.json()` to send responses  
  * Practiced sending:
    * Text responses  
    * JSON objects  
  * Understood how backend responds to frontend requests  

* **GET Method & POST Method**

  * **GET Method**
    * Used to fetch data from the server  
    * Practiced simple routes like:
      ```js
      app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send("Welcome to the server!");
      });
      ```

  * **POST Method**
    * Used to send data to the server  
    * Understood how POST requests are used for form submissions and API data creation
